# NFL_Model

This project uses data from four seasons of the NFL to predict passing yards and whether an instance of passing yards will be over/under a betting line. 

Nearly all data manipulation takes place in the R scripts. 

The regressions and machine learning techniques are contained in two python scripts. Firstly, Data_Explore.pynb and secondly Logistic_Regressions.pynb
